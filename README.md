My project was inspired by an instagram post made by 'designrulesco' from July 2024, link to the original post is: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9foI0USKJb .
Further info on their product webisite https://www.designrules.co where they sell metro-styled maps of 
cities in the USA, where the stations illuminate whenever a train is departing from them.

My goal was to do just that, but here in Vienna :)

Fortunately WienerLinien, the company operating the Vienna metro provides a real-time API system, 
through which in particular one can request future departures for each station. No API-key required.
Documentation and further informations can be found here: https://www.wienerlinien.at/ogd_realtime/doku .
In the following I want to give a short introduction on how I used this service to create the 'WienerLinienMonitor'.
